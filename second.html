<p>The bridge is expected to boost the GDP of Bangladesh by up to <b> 1.23</b> percent.[10] 13 districts, of a total 21, will be connected by the bridge to other regions of the country which have an above-average poverty rate. Following the inauguration of the bridge, economic activity in the southwestern regions are expected to be significantly boosted, with several big companies already starting their productions there.[11] 17 economic zones are planned at different places in the southwestern region.[12] Since its inauguration, the Padma Multipurpose Bridge has generated approximately Tk. 800 crore through toll collection in one year. Data analysis from the bridge department reveals that on average, more than 15,000 vehicles cross the bridge on a daily basis. To ensure convenient trips to other destinations by crossing the Padma Bridge, the government of Bangladesh has initiated numerous projects, including the Dhaka-Mawa-Bhanga Elevated Expressway, aimed at enhancing road connectivity.[13]</p>
